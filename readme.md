This work started as something beautful and turned into a monster, like many things in life. I also don't have time to compete with Lisas crazy GIF.
So instead of spending the whole time trying to work out whats going on, how about you find some interesting relationships in the demonstration.

The focus here is what nationalities climbed what mountains, and how did they go? How old were they? What was their death rate? etc....
Top left is the total number of climbers (There is a log flag in the code but it looks better here like so. Right is the death ratio per attempt. Bottom left is success rate as a percnt. Bottom right is the average age. 

As you can see, Nepal is successful at climing many mountains. India has had some trajedies in the Himalayas, The average age for nepalese climbers is well below their employer counterparts. Nepalese mountains such as Ama Damblam, Everest, Cho Oyu, Everest and Lhotese have unusually high success rates, likely due to sherpa support. 


Script can be run like
Create these by running

```python pittman_plotathon_entry.py```

Requires Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib. 

Which produces my entry:
